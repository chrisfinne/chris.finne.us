Dates me...

- You connected to BBS's and not the Internet
- You would have a specific "Level" of access on the BBS and you had to know someone to get to a higher level where there were more features and downloads
- A BBS only had so many telephone lines, sometimes just 1, so you often got a busy signal
- Modems were 300 baud
- You would manually dial the number, wait for the right signal and then turn on your modem
- You could get a modem that was a rubber cradle for a telephone, just like the one used in the classic movie War Games
- Cassette tapes were the standard storage mechanism
- 5 1/4" floppies were for the serious players and hard drives cost thousands of dollars
- 5 1/4" floppies were either single-sided or double-sided. I used to buy the single-sided because they were cheaper and just use a hole-punch to make them double-sided
- There was a lame keyboard you could get for your Atari to try to make it look like a computer
- If you knew how to hit Ctrl-C to break a program, then type "run" to start it again, you were a computer expert
