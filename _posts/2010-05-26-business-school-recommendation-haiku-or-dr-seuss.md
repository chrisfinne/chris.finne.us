title: Business School Recommendation Haiku or Dr Seuss
date: 2010/05/26
---

I'm writing a recommendation for a colleague for his business school application.

Do you get extra credit if I submit the recommendation as a haiku?

<blockquote>
jon burr is a man
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
who suffered at supportsoft
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
he is better now
</blockquote>

How about iambic pentameter?

<blockquote>
jon spent many nights on the road for us
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
he solved clients' woes from near and from far
</blockquote>
struggling with the next line.


<br/><br/>
I know! Good old Dr. Seuss will make a good impression.

<blockquote>
who goes to school?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
jon goes to school.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
but jon went to school?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
now jon wants more school.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
is he a fool to want more school?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
no, i think it is cool.
</blockquote>


ok, now i'm just procrastinating and a little punchy at 4:30am. back to the code.
